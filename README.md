# Readable-code

## Mission

To clean a code.

## Learning Objectives

- To be able to make decisions about when and how to refactor less readable code.
- To be able to adhere to known PHP code standards like PSR2.
- To be able to think critically about code principles and not follow them blindly.

### Must-have features

- Have a look at [this code](experimental.php) and try to understand what it does.
- Read the following article:
  - [Jason McCreary on writing clean code](https://dev.to/gonedark/writing-clean-code)
  - Do not install PHP codesniffer at this point (yet)
- Have the code follow a consistent writing standard. For now, we'll roll with the widely used [PSR2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).
  - Focus just on what you need for now (functions, variables).
  - Use them examples instead of the instructions, they are much easier to use.
- Rewrite the file in a way that would improve readability for you (keep everything to one file).
